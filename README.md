# Velox [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LFalch/velox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LFalch/velox)

A space ship shooter game where you program the ships' AI. Very much WIP!

The original version was written in Java and had a lot more features, but that
project had been more or less abandoned.

The game uses my game engine [korome](https://github.com/LFalch/korome) (which
was in fact also written in Java originally).

## Idea

The idea is a multiplayer game with space ships shooting at each other with the
goal of trying to destroy the opponent. Though you won't be able to control your
ship with keyboard and mouse: You'll have to program it.

The ship will have systems on them, most important of which are the weapon and
sensor systems. The sensor systems will be the source of input when
programming the ships.
